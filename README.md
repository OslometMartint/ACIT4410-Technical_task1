This project takes advantage of an HTML template developed by someoneone else.
The primary task of the project is to create a deployment pipeline using Docker, Git and Jenkins.
As such, it seemed beneficial to use existing an existing HTML template to remove unecessary workload outside the scope of the assignment.
Information about the template is found below.
